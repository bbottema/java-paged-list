**`PagedList`** is a light-weight Java `List` implementation that works with a page size. Each time a `fooList.get(i)` is invoked, the list will check if it has fetched the page before containing that entry and will get the new page if necessary.

The `PagedList` works with an interface **`DataProvider`**, which is an interface that can be implemented by some database DAO for example. It could also be a service that gets it through SOAP, JMS or from a file. The `PagedList` doesn't care as long as it gets a `DataProvider` imlementation.
